# A Poem for the Codebase

Lines of logic, row on row,
through the functions, data flows.
A bug appears — we trace, we read,
a missing comma was the deed.

The tests go green, the build is clean,
the diff reviewed, the merge serene.
Tomorrow brings another quest:
new features, fixes — we code our best.

## Commentary

This poem captures the everyday drama of software development in six
couplets.  The opening ("Lines of logic, row on row") echoes the
mechanical precision of code while borrowing the cadence of verse — a
deliberate tension between art and engineering.

The turning point is the comma bug: a single missing character that
derails an entire system.  It's both absurd and honest.  The most
consequential defects are rarely architectural — they're punctuation.

The closing stanza ("Tomorrow brings another quest") resists closure.
There is no final victory in software, only the next iteration.  The
poem ends on "best," not "done," because done is a myth we tell
stakeholders.
