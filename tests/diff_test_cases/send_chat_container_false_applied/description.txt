Test case for SendChatContainer where second chunk is falsely detected as already applied

This test case reproduces a bug where:
1. First hunk succeeds in system patch stage and modifies the file
2. Second hunk reaches difflib stage and is incorrectly detected as "already applied" 
   because the "already applied" check uses the modified file content instead of original content
3. This causes the second hunk to be skipped even though it should be applied

The fix ensures that "already applied" checks use the original file content, not the current modified content.
