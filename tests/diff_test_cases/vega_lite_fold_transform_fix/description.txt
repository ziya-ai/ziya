Test case for VegaLite plugin fold transform field fix

This test case adds additional field name fixes for fold transforms:
1. Fixes "key" field references to use the actual key field name from fold transform
2. Fixes "dimension" field references to use the actual key field name (common in parallel coordinates)

The diff extends existing fold transform handling to cover more generic field name patterns.
